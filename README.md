## The Challenge

Developing enterprise services for access to data (CRUD) can be deceptively simple.  Just write something that gives access to the data you need.  Done!

Well...not quite.  The challenge arises as the business grows and with it the number applications and services built to support the growth.  How do you avoid duplicating the data access layer for every service or web app you write?  How do you keep track of application and service inter-dependencies?  How do you audit and manage access to your enterprise data?  How do you continue supporting the growth while building systems to scale?

There are many projects for lightblue corresponding to the flexibility depected above.  They are each documented here.

Lightblue is an open source project built from the ground up to be very flexible.  This plugin based component architecture enables deployment of lightblue in virtually any environment and with only the plugins needed enabled.  This bascially means you can deploy lightblue where you want and plug in the puzzle pieces you want!
